# Kotlin Bootstrap (base / project skeleton)

[![Software License][ico-license]][link-license]

## Introduction

This is a repository intended to serve as a starting point if you want to bootstrap a project in Kotlin.

It could be useful if you want to start from scratch a kata or a little exercise or project. The idea is that you don't have to worry about the boilerplate
* Latest stable kotlin version
* Best practices applied:
    * [`README.md`][link-readme]
    * [`LICENSE`][link-license]
    * [`build.gradle.kts`][link-build-gradle]
    * [`.gitignore`][link-gitignore]
* Some useful resources to start coding

## How To Start

You could manually clone [this repo](https://github.com/CodelyTV/kotlin-basic-skeleton) or just us it as a template

### Cloning the repository

We recommend to follow the next step by step process in order to avoid adding the bootstrap project commits to your project Git history:

1. [Use this repositoy template](https://github.com/CodelyTV/kotlin-basic-skeleton/generate)
2. Clone your project
3. Move to the project directory: `cd your-project-name`
5. Build the project for the first time: `./gradlew build`
6. Run all the checks: `./gradlew check`. This will do some checks that you can perform with isolated commands:
    1. [Klint](https://ktlint.github.io/) using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless): `./gradlew spotlessCheck`. If you want to fix style issues automatically: `./gradlew spotlessApply`.
    2. [Kotlin test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/): `./gradlew test`.
7. To just run the project execute: `./gradlew run`
7. Start coding!
